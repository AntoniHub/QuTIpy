def Werner_state(p,d,alt_param=False):

    '''
    Generates the Werner state with parameter p on two d-dimensional systems.
    The state is defined as

        rho_W=p*singlet+(1-p)*singlet_perp,
        
    where singlet is the state defined as (1/(d^2-d))*(eye(d^2)-SWAP) and
    singlet_perp is the state defined as (1/(d^2+d))*(eye(d^2)+SWAP),
    where SWAP is the swap operator between two d-dimensional systems. The parameter
    p is between 0 and 1.
    
    Werner states are invariant under U âŠ— U for every unitary U.

    If alt_param=True, then the function returns a different parameterization of 
    the Werner state in which the parameter p is between -1 and 1, and

        rho_W=(1/(d^2-d*p))*(eye(d^2)-p*SWAP)
