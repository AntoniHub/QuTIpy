def Werner_state(p,d,alt_param=False):

    '''
    Generates the Werner state with parameter p on two d-dimensional systems.
    The state is defined as

        rho_W=(1/(d^2-dp))*(eye(d^2)-p*SWAP),

    where SWAP is the swap operator between two d-dimensional systems and 
    p is between -1 and 1. Werner states are invariant under U âŠ— U for every
    unitary U.

    If alt_param=True, then the function returns a different parameterization of 
    the Werner state in which the parameter p is the fraction of the
    d-dimensional singlet state, which is defined as

        (1/(d^2-d))*(eye(d^2)-SWAP)
